      <h1>Trigonometry Functions</h1>
      
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
         <p> Hello! Welcome to my first HTML webpage! This webpage talks about some trigonometry functions that I recently learned in my Geometry class. 
         </p>

      <h3>Normal <abbr title = Trigonometry>Trig</abbr> Functions</h3>
         <p>The normal trig functions take the measure of an angle in a right triangle and gives out the ratio between two side lengths 
         The basic functions are: 
            <ul>
            <li>sine or <b>sin</b></li>
            <li>cosine or <b>cos</b></li>  
            <li>tangent or <b>tan</b></li> 
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p>Sine is the ratio between the lrg opposite the angle and the hypotenuse.  
            Cosine is the ratio between the leg adjacent to the angle and the hypotenuse.
            Tangent is the ratio between the leg opposite the angle and the leg adjecent to the angle.

      <h3>Inverse Functions</h3>
         <p>The inverse trig functions take the ratio between two sides of a right
         and spits out the measure of the angle. The functions are:
            <ul>
            <li>cosecant or <b >sin<sup>-1</sup> </b> </li>
            <li>secant or <b>cos<sup>-1</sup> </b> </li>  
            <li>arctangent or <b>tan<sup>-1</sup> </b> </li> 
            </ul>
         </p>
